   The teacher announced: "This is a simple example
showing several sentences of text."  The students
where instantaneously amazed!

With surprise, the teacher's dog stood up and barked
"Ruff! Ruff!! Ruff!!!"  The students were surprised
and burst into applause, much to the teacher's chagrin.

That is all, folks!              [86 and out].
